  A group project built by the SuperAwesome Team, with the aim of tackling food wastage by creating a social food sharing app, where people can search for products then set up times with other users to exchange.

  My roles included setting up the back end RESTful API, implementing the use of the
  Tesco API for product searches and helping with the styling using CSS and the Foundations framework.
