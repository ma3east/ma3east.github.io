I have been teaching myself to code over the last few months, and then decided I needed to fast track my learning, and was accepted and completed the General Assembly Web Development Immersive course.

I loved being exposed to so many different technologies, languages/frameworks.  Using APIs was cool and something I look forward to doing more in the future, and I loved learning and doing more with the back end, using NodeJs and Rails for example.

I look forward to continue to learn how to be a better developer and being exposed to even more frameworks, I would also like to give back by helping others on this journey if I can.

Feel free to contact me to discuss any opportunities.
