                Over the past 15 years I have been working in system support roles for software companies but have always had an interest in development. After spending some time teaching myself to code I decided to immerse myself in the General Assembly Web Development programme. Combining my previous experience with a good foundation in web development from GA I am now looking for opportunities where I can continue my journey of learning to be a great developer. 

                During my time at GA I used a number of technologies which are showcased in some of my projects below.
