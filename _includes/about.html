            Over the past 15 years I have been working in system support roles for software companies but <b>have always had an interest in development</b>. After spending some time teaching myself to code I decided to immerse myself in the General Assembly Web Development programme. Combining my previous experience with a good foundation in web development from GA I am now looking for opportunities where I can continue my journey of learning to be a great developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my time at GA I used a number of technologies which are showcased in some of my projects below.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am continuing to learn the technologies I have been exposed to through GA, but also new one's, like my cube :), even if just for fun. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy attending meetups and where I can helping out, have helped coached beginners HTML/CSS and volunteered at a tech conference - BeyondConf.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will never stop learning to code and about the latest technologies/tools available.  Whist I continue to do this I am also helping small businesses and community groups with their digital needs, helping them to have an online presence or connect with their customers/members.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>
              I am always happy to get involved with new projects.
            </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            When I am not coding, I enjoy watching films, travelling, and learning how to be a better photographer.
          </p>

              Feel free to get in touch to discuss opportunities.
