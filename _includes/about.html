        Over the past 15 years I have been working in system support roles for software companies but <b>have always had an interest in development</b>. <br>After spending some time teaching myself to code I decided to immerse myself in the General Assembly Web Development programme. Combining my previous experience with a good foundation in web development from GA I am now looking for opportunities where I can continue my journey of learning to be a great developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my time at GA I used a number of technologies which are showcased in some of my projects further below.

        <div id="myCanvas" class="img-responsive"></div> 
        <p>
          I am continuing to learn the technologies I have been exposed to through GA, but also new one's, like my cube :), even if just for fun. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy attending meetups and where I can helping out, have helped coached beginners HTML/CSS and volunteered at a tech conference,  <a href="http://beyondconf.co/" target="_blank">BeyondConf</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will never stop learning to code and about the latest technologies/tools available.  Whist I continue to do this I am also helping small businesses and community groups with their digital needs, helping them to have an online presence or connect with their customers/members.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I am not coding, I enjoy watching films, travelling, and learning how to be a better photographer.
        </p>

            I am always happy to get involved with new projects. Feel free to get in touch to discuss opportunities.
